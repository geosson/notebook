    "# Recognize Digits\n",
    "\n",
    "The source code for this tutorial is under [book/recognize_digits](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/book/tree/develop/recognize_digits). First-time readers, please refer to PaddlePaddle [installation instructions](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/blob/develop/doc/getstarted/build_and_install/docker_install_en.rst).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "When we learn a new programming language, the first task is usually to write a program that prints \"Hello World.\" In Machine Learning or Deep Learning, the equivalent task is to train a model to perform handwritten digit recognition with [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset. Handwriting recognition is a typical image classification problem. The problem is relatively easy, and MNIST is a complete dataset. As a simple Computer Vision dataset, MNIST contains images of handwritten digits and their corresponding labels (Fig. 1). The input image is a 28x28 matrix, and the label is one of the digits from 0 to 9. Each image is normalized in size and centered.\n",
    "\n",

    "<img src=\"image/mnist_example_image.png\" width=\"400\"><br/>\n",
    "Fig. 1. Examples of MNIST images\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The MNIST dataset is created from the [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/srd/nist-special-database-19) Special Database 3 (SD-3) and the Special Database 1 (SD-1). The SD-3 is labeled by the staff of the U.S. Census Bureau, while SD-1 is labeled by high school students the in U.S. Therefore the SD-3 is cleaner and easier to recognize than the SD-1 dataset. Yann LeCun et al. used half of the samples from each of SD-1 and SD-3 to create the MNIST training set (60,000 samples) and test set (10,000 samples), where training set was labeled by 250 different annotators, and it was guaranteed that there wasn't a complete overlap of annotators of training set and test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yann LeCun, one of the founders of Deep Learning, contributed highly towards handwritten character recognition in early days and proposed CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), which drastically improved recognition capability for handwritten characters. CNNs are now a critical concept in Deep Learning. From Yann LeCun's first proposal of LeNet to those winning models in ImageNet, such as VGGNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet, etc. (Please refer to [Image Classification](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/book/tree/develop/image_classification) tutorial), CNN achieved a series of impressive results in Image Classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many algorithms are tested on MNIST. In 1998, LeCun experimented with single layer linear classifier, MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) and Multilayer CNN LeNet. These algorithms constantly reduced test error from 12% to 0.7% \\[[1](#References)\\]. Since then, researchers have worked on many algorithms such as k-NN (K-Nearest Neighbors) \\[[2](#References)\\], Support Vector Machine (SVM) \\[[3](#References)\\], Neural Networks \\[[4-7](#References)\\] and Boosting \\[[8](#References)\\]. Various preprocessing methods like distortion removal, noise removal, blurring etc. have also been applied to increase recognition accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we tackle the task of handwritten character recognition. We start with a simple softmax regression model and guide our readers step-by-step to improve this model's performance on the task of recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Before introducing classification algorithms and training procedure, we provide some definitions:\n",
    "- $X$ is the input: Input is a $28\\times28$ MNIST image. It is flattened to a $784$ dimensional vector. $X=\\left ( x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{783} \\right )$.\n",
    "- $Y$ is the output: Output of the classifier is 1 of the 10 classes (digits from 0 to 9). $Y=\\left ( y_0, y_1, \\dots, y_9 \\right )$. Each dimension $y_i$ represents the probability that the input image belongs to class $i$.\n",
    "- $L$ is the ground truth label: $L=\\left ( l_0, l_1, \\dots, l_9 \\right )$. It is also 10 dimensional, but only one dimension is 1 and all others are all 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Softmax Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In a simple softmax regression model, the input is fed to fully connected layers and a softmax function is applied to get probabilities of multiple output classes\\[[9](#References)\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "Input $X$ is multiplied with weights $W$, and bias $b$ is added to generate activations.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_i = \\text{softmax}(\\sum_j W_{i,j}x_j + b_i) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ \\text{softmax}(x_i) = \\frac{e^{x_i}}{\\sum_j e^{x_j}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "For an $N$ class classification problem with $N$ output nodes, an $N$ dimensional vector is normalized to $N$ real values in the range [0, 1], each representing the probability of the sample to belong to the class. Here $y_i$ is the prediction probability that an image is digit $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such a classification problem, we usually use the cross entropy loss function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$  \\text{crossentropy}(label, y) = -\\sum_i label_ilog(y_i) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Fig. 2 shows a softmax regression network, with weights in blue, and bias in red. +1 indicates bias is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"image/softmax_regression_en.png\" width=400><br/>\n",
    "Fig. 2. Softmax regression network architecture<br/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multilayer Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "The Softmax regression model described above uses the simplest two-layer neural network, i.e. it only contains an input layer and an output layer. So its regression ability is limited. To achieve better recognition results, we consider adding several hidden layers \\[[10](#References)\\] between the input layer and the output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After the first hidden layer, we get $ H_1 = \\phi(W_1X + b_1) $, where $\\phi$ is the activation function. Some common ones are sigmoid, tanh and ReLU.<br/>\n",
    "2. After the second hidden layer, we get $ H_2 = \\phi(W_2H_1 + b_2) $.<br/>\n",
    "3. Finally, after output layer, we get $Y=\\text{softmax}(W_3H_2 + b_3)$, the final classification result vector.<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Fig. 3. is Multilayer Perceptron network, with weights in blue, and bias in red. +1 indicates bias is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"image/mlp_en.png\" width=500><br/>\n",

    "\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convolutional Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Convolutional Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"image/conv_layer.png\" width='750'><br/>\n",
    "Fig. 4. Convolutional layer<br/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Convolutional layer is the core of a Convolutional Neural Network. The parameters in this layer are composed of a set of filters or kernels. In the forward step, each kernel moves horizontally and vertically, we compute a dot product of the kernel and the input at the corresponding positions, to this result we add bias and apply an activation function. The result is a two-dimensional activation map. For example, some kernel may recognize corners, and some may recognize circles. These convolution kernels may respond strongly to the corresponding features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fig. 4 is a dynamic graph of a convolutional layer, where depths are not shown for simplicity. Input is $W_1=5, H_1=5, D_1=3$. In fact, this is a common representation for colored images. $W_1$ and  $H_1$ of a colored image correspond to the width and height respectively. $D_1$ corresponds to the 3 color channels for RGB. The parameters of the convolutional layer are $K=2, F=3, S=2, P=1$. $K$ is the number of kernels. Here, $Filter W_0$ and $Filter   W_1$ are two kernels. $F$ is kernel size. $W0$ and $W1$ are both $3\\times3$ matrix in all depths. $S$ is the stride. Kernels move leftwards or downwards by 2 units each time. $P$ is padding, an extension of the input. The gray area in the figure shows zero padding with size 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pooling Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"image/max_pooling_en.png\" width=\"400px\"><br/>\n",
    "Fig. 5 Pooling layer<br/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "A Pooling layer performs downsampling. The main functionality of this layer is to reduce computation by reducing the network parameters. It also prevents overfitting to some extent. Usually, a pooling layer is added after a convolutional layer. Pooling layer can be of various types like max pooling, average pooling, etc. Max pooling uses rectangles to segment the input layer into several parts and computes the maximum value in each part as the output (Fig. 5.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LeNet-5 Network\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"image/cnn_en.png\"><br/>\n",
    "Fig. 6. LeNet-5 Convolutional Neural Network architecture<br/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "[LeNet-5](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/) is one of the simplest Convolutional Neural Networks. Fig. 6. shows its architecture: A 2-dimensional input image is fed into two sets of convolutional layers and pooling layers, this output is then fed to a fully connected layer and a softmax classifier. The following three properties of convolution enable LeNet-5 to better recognize images than Multilayer fully connected perceptrons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3D properties of neurons: a convolutional layer is organized by width, height and depth. Neurons in each layer are connected to only a small region in the previous layer. This region is called the receptive field.\n",
    "- Local connection: A CNN utilizes the local space correlation by connecting local neurons. This design guarantees that the learned filter has a strong response to local input features. Stacking many such layers generates a non-linear filter that is more global. This enables the network to first obtain good representation for small parts of input and then combine them to represent a larger region.\n",
    "- Sharing weights: In a CNN, computation is iterated on shared parameters (weights and bias) to form a feature map. This means all neurons in the same depth of the output respond to the same feature. This allows detecting a feature regardless of its position in the input and enables translation equivariance.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### List of Common Activation Functions  \n",
    "- Sigmoid activation function: $ f(x) = sigmoid(x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tanh activation function: $ f(x) = tanh(x) = \\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{e^x+e^{-x}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "  In fact, tanh function is just a rescaled version of the sigmoid function. It is obtained by magnifying the value of the sigmoid function and moving it downwards by 1.\n",

The subsequent tutorials will derive more sophisticated models from these. So it is crucial to understand these models for future learning. When our model evolved from a simple softmax regression to slightly complex Convolutional Neural Network, the recognition accuracy on the MNIST data set achieved large improvement in accuracy. This is due to the Convolutional layers' local connections and parameter sharing. While learning new models in the future, we encourage the readers to understand the key ideas that lead a new model to improve results of an old one. Moreover, this tutorial introduced the basic flow of PaddlePaddle model design, starting with a dataprovider, model layer construction, to final training and prediction. Readers can leverage the flow used in this MNIST handwritten digit classification example and experiment with different data and network architectures to train models for classification tasks of their choice.\n",
